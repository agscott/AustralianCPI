### Quarterly Report with 2 Year Trend

This is a report into the Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI)^[as prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics https://www.abs.gov.au] for the quarter ending `r tail(xx$Dates,1)`. The chart below sets out these results over the last 2 years.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)

  plot_ly(x=~Dates, y=~IncrPer, data=xx, hovertemplate=~paste0("Increase:<br>",IncrPer,"%","<extra></extra>"), type="bar", #colors=c(3:4),
        text=~signif(IncrPer,2), name="Increase") %>%
  
  layout(title=list(text="Australian CPI - Quarterly",font=list(size=15)), 
         yaxis=list(title="Quarterly Increase - %", dtick=0.2, font=list(size=14)), 
         xaxis=list(title="Quarter", font=list(size=14)),
         margin=list(l=50,r=50,b=70,t=70,pad=10)) %>%
  
  add_trace(x=~Dates,y=~Index, mode="marker+lines",line=list(width=4), marker=list(size=9),yaxis="y2", type="scatter",
              yaxis="y2", size=4, name="Raw Index", inherent=T,

  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying="y", side="right", title="Index"), legend=list(bgcolor="#D1D1D9"))

#### Details

The bar chart shows the % movement in the CPI for quarter-on-quarter and also the overall index for each quarter between `r min(xx$Dates)` and `r max(xx$Dates)`.

The results show that the CPI index had a `r signif(tail(xx$IncrPer,1),2)`% `r ifelse(tail(xx$IncrPer,1)>=0,Word("increase"),Word("decrease"))` in the latest quarter of `r tail(xx$Dates,1)` and this movement was `r ifelse(abs(tail(xx$IncrPer,1)-tail(xx$IncrPer,2)[-2])>0.5,Word("significantly"),"")` `r ifelse(tail(xx$IncrPer,1)>tail(xx$IncrPer,2)[-2],Word("higher"),Word("lower"))` than the previous quarter of `r signif(tail(xx$IncrPer,2)[-2],2)`%. This corresponds to the axis on the left hand side. The trend in CPI movements for the last 4 quarters has been `r direction(tail(xx$IncrPer,4))`. Over the last 2 years, the highest quarterly movement was `r signif(max(xx$IncrPer),2)`% in `r xx$Dates[which(xx$IncrPer==max(xx$IncrPer))]` followed by `r signif(xx$IncrPer[order(xx$IncrPer, decreasing=T)==2],2)`% in `r xx$Dates[order(xx$IncrPer, decreasing=T)==2]` while the lowest was `r signif(min(xx$IncrPer),2)`% in `r xx$Dates[which(xx$IncrPer==min(xx$IncrPer))]`.

The overlaid line shows the overall index as `r round(tail(xx$Index,1),1)` for the latest quarter of `r tail(xx$Dates,1)` with  this being `r ifelse(abs(tail(xx$Index,1)-tail(xx$Index,2)[-2])>5,Word("significantly"),"")` `r ifelse(tail(xx$Index,1)>tail(xx$Index,2)[-2],Word("higher"),Word("lower"))` than the previous quarter of `r round(tail(xx$Index,2)[-2],1)`. This corresponds to the axis on the right hand side. The trend for the index over the last 4 quarters has been `r direction(tail(xx$Index,5))`.
